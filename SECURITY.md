# Security Policy

## Scope

This security policy applies to :
 - Crowdsec agent
 - Crowdsec Local API
## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are extremely grateful to security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities regarding the Crowdsec project. All reports are thoroughly investigated by members of the Crowdsec organization.

You can email the private [wojtekxtx[at]gmail[dot]com](mailto:wojtekxtx@gmail.com) list with the security details.

## When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

 - You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Crowdsec
 - You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Crowdsec
 - You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Crowdsec depends on

For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.
